# Task 7 – SVM Classification

## 🔍 Objective
Apply Support Vector Machines (SVM) using both **linear** and **RBF** kernels on a binary classification problem (Breast Cancer Dataset).

---

## 📚 Dataset
- **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset** from Scikit-learn or Kaggle.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy

---

## ✅ Steps Performed
1. Loaded and preprocessed dataset.
2. Scaled features using StandardScaler.
3. Trained SVM using:
   - Linear Kernel
   - RBF Kernel
4. Evaluated using Confusion Matrix and Classification Report.
5. Performed Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV.
6. Visualized decision boundary using 2D features.

---

## 📊 Results
- Achieved high accuracy on both training and testing data.
- Best hyperparameters obtained: `C=1`, `gamma=0.1` with RBF kernel.
